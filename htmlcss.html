                <h1>W3C</h1>
                <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international organization committed to improving the web. It is made up of several hundred member organizations from a variety of related IT industries. W3C sets standards for the World Wide Web (WWW) to facilitate interoperability and cooperation among all web stakeholders. It was established in 1994 by the creator of the WWW</p>
                <p>Standards developed by the Consortium include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CGI</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>DOM</li>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>HTTP</li>
                    <li>XHTML</li>
                    <li>XML</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Explanation</h4>
                <p>The mission of the W3C is to lead the Web to its full potential by developing relevant protocols and guidelines. This is achieved primarily by creating and publishing Web standards. By adopting the Web standards created by the W3C, hardware manufacturers and software developers can ensure their equipment and programs work with the latest Web technologies. For example, most Web browsers incorporate several W3C standards, which allows them to interpret the latest versions of HTML and CSS code. When browsers conform to the W3C standards, it also helps Web pages appear consistent across different browsers.</p>

                <h1>HTML</h1>
                <h4>What is HTML?</h4>
                <p>
                    Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing.<br>
                    HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.<br>
                The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.</p>
                <h4>What Are HTML Tags?</h4>
                <p>Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. Most tags must be opened and closed in order to function.</p>
                <h4>
                What are HTML Attributes?</h4>
                <p>Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.</p>
                <h1>CSS</h1>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
                <h4>Advantages of CSS</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CSS saves time</strong> - You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pages load faster</strong> - If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy maintenance</strong> - To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</li>
                </ul>
