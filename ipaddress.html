                <h1>IP Address</h1>
                <h4>What is IP Address</h4>
                <p>IP address stands for internet protocol address; it is an identifying number that is associated with a specific computer or computer network. When connected to the internet, the IP address allows the computers to send and receive information.</p>
                <h4>Explanation</h4>
                <p>An IP address (internet protocol address) is a numerical representation that uniquely identifies a specific interface on the network.
                    Addresses in IPv4 are 32-bits long. This allows for a maximum of 4,294,967,296 (232) unique addresses. Addresses in IPv6 are 128-bits, which allows for 3.4 x 1038 (2128) unique addresses.
                    The total usable address pool of both versions is reduced by various reserved addresses and other considerations.
                IP addresses are binary numbers but are typically expressed in decimal form (IPv4) or hexadecimal form (IPv6) to make reading and using them easier for humans.</p>
                <h4>How IP Works</h4>
                <p>IP is designed to work over a dynamic network. This means that IP must work without a central directory or monitor, and that it cannot rely upon specific links or nodes existing. IP is a connectionless protocol that is datagram-oriented., so each packet must contain the source IP address, destination IP address, and other data in the header to be successfully delivered.
                    Combined, these factors make IP an unreliable, best effort delivery protocol. Error correction is handled by upper level protocols instead. These protocols include TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol, and UDP, which is a connectionless protocol.
                Most internet traffic is TCP/IP.</p>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <div>
                    <img src="img/ip.png" class="img-fluid">
                </div>
                <h1>Packets</h1>
                <p>A packet is the unit of data that is routed between an origin and a destination on the Internet or any other packet-switched network.
                </p>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>As an example, e-mails and web pages will make use of network packets to send information back and forth to the user and recipients. The goal of a network packet is to send information reliably so data does not have to be sent as a single, large file.
                Each packet sent includes information such as the source and destination.</p>
                <h1>Routing</h1>
                <p>Network routing is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks. The principles of routing can apply to any type of network, from telephone networks to public transportation. In packet-switching networks, such as the Internet, routing selects the paths for Internet Protocol (IP) packets to travel from their origin to their destination. These Internet routing decisions are made by specialized pieces of network hardware called routers.</p>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>Consider the image below. For a data packet to get from Computer A to Computer B, should it pass through networks 1, 3, and 5 or networks 2 and 4? The packet will take a shorter path through networks 2 and 4, but networks 1, 3, and 5 might be faster at forwarding packets than 2 and 4. These are the kinds of choices network routers constantly make.</p>
